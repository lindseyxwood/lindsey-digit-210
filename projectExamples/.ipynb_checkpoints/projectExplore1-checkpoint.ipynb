      "and dream about being an astronaut. \n",
      "I just didn't have the grades. Nor the \n",

      "Hey, Leela. Look at me!\n",

      "does a guy have to do?\n",
      "Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show \n",
      "her my real surprise.\n",
      "Look. I've been studying how to pilot \n",
      "the ship. Impressed?\n",

      "me, and when I figure out what it is \n",
      "-\n",
      "Of course not.\n",

      "It's out again.\n",
      "It's back on!\n",
      "It's tempting, but, well, I am already \n",
      "kinda settled in here.\n",
      "Uh, listen, is there maybe some way \n",
      "we could do this with you going and \n",
      "me not going?\n",
      "Well, you were gonna live in the closet \n",

      "Same thing.\n",
      "What up?\n",
      "Silent? You've been meddling for two \n",
      "solid weeks.\n",
      "Really? I didn't think he'd miss this \n",

      "Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew \n",
      "where he was I'd go talk to him.\n",
      "Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind \n",
      "stinking sober!\n",
      "Don't do it!\n",
      "Cutting Leela's head off won't solve \n",
      "anything!\n",
      "Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give \n",
      "you a hand?\n",
      "But it's a useless antenna. It's not \n",
      "like he's a ham radio or something.\n",
      "Hey, it works! The static's gone.\n",
      "She's right.\n",
      "Apology accepted. After all, you're \n",
      "only human.\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, \n",
      "if we found your antenna could they \n",
      "still reattach it?\n",
      "It's good to be home.\n",
      "So that's where those skin flakes went. \n",
      "Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's \n",
      "going to get enough light?\n",
      "This is huge! Bender, why don't I just \n",
      "live in here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, what you watching?\n",
      "Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.\n",
      "You're gonna be the ship's cook?\n",
      "Bam!\n",
      "So this is Little Neptune?\n",
      "Ooh! What's this?\n",
      "Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.\n",
      "Hmm, I can see where that would be an \n",
      "advantage. Do you take cash?\n",
      "I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew \n",
      "up in this city. These are my people. \n",
      "What up?\n",
      "See?\n",
      "Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat \n",
      "here except human!\n",
      "Now that you mention it, I do have trouble \n",
      "breathing underwater sometimes. I'll \n",
      "take the gills.\n",
      "Can't imagine why I would.\n",
      "I'm capable of making my own decisions, \n",
      "Leela. Did you ever stop to think I \n",
      "might be happier with gills?\n",
      "(shouting) Hey Bender how's dinner coming?\n",
      "Yeah, OK.\n",
      "That's the saltiest thing I've ever \n",
      "tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl \n",
      "of salt!\n",
      "My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna \n",
      "die.\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      "Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering \n",
      "things before you were born! I think \n",
      "I know what I'm doing.\n",
      "Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. \n",
      "Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!\n",
      "Hello? Anybody home?\n",
      "No! It wasn't me!\n",
      "I didn't mean to. He just looked so \n",
      "cool and refreshing.\n",
      "It could have been. But chances were \n",
      "equally good it was an Emperor.\n",
      "You might.\n",
      "I gotta go with Bender.\n",
      "Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better \n",
      "check with my Prime Minister.\n",
      "Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just \n",
      "in time.\n",
      "Umm, how about that one?\n",
      "On second thought, I'll take that one.\n",
      "You don't have to beat around the bush, \n",
      "Leela, we all know who you're talking \n",
      "about...uh, me, right?\n",
      "There won't be a lot of long-winded \n",
      "speeches, will there?\n",
      "Will there be cake?\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!\n",
      "So?\n",
      "80,000 years?\n",
      "Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked \n",
      "unless it was really high or really \n",
      "low.\n",
      "Well at least my assassin will get what's \n",
      "coming to him.\n",
      "Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis \n",
      "myself.\n",
      "Yeah, I was going to thumb through that \n",
      "later.\n",
      "Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, \n",
      "I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't \n",
      "even be here in the year 3000. It's \n",
      "just like the story of the grasshopper \n",
      "and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper \n",
      "kept burying acorns for winter while \n",
      "the octopus mooched off his girlfriend \n",
      "and watched TV. But then the winter \n",
      "came and the grasshopper died and the \n",
      "octopus ate all his acorns and also \n",
      "he got a racecar. Is any of this getting \n",
      "through to you?\n",
      "Who asked you to? I told you a hundred \n",
      "times to stop treating me like a baby. \n",
      "Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging \n",
      "grasshopper.\n",
      "I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's \n",
      "gonna drink me.  Quit it!\n",
      "What up?\n",
      "Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, \n",

      "My tummy hurts!\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      "What am I gonna do?\n",
      "But won't that crush my bones?\n",
      "I could vomit or urinate. Would you \n",
      "feel better about that?\n",
      "That's a great idea! Crying.\n",
      "It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just \n",
      "too macho.\n",
      "What do you mean? I was Emperor of a \n",
      "whole planet.\n",
      "These things happen.\n",
      "Phew! That's a load off my mind.\n",
      "She'll never help me. She's still mad \n",
      "that I told her never to help me.\n",
      "What the hell is that?\n",
      "This is the saddest day of my life. \n",
      "And I still can't cry.\n",
      "I can't believe it. She's risking her \n",

      "her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.\n",
      "Is she alright?\n",
      "No. No!\n",
      "This can't be happening.\n",
      "All Leela ever wanted to do was help \n",
      "me. But I was to proud, too stupid to \n",
      "accept it.  I wish I had died instead \n",
      "of her.\n",
      "Leela! You're alive!\n",
      "Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take \n",
      "all the help you're willing to give. \n",
      "I know you just want what's best for \n",
      "me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come \n",
      "on!  That hurt!\n",
      "(crying) Oh, now I understand.\n",
      "(crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you \n",
      "all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it \n",
      "out, Bender! That's a tender area!\n",
      "Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?\n",
      "Oh, you're welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine \n",
      "the look on their faces when you show \n",
      "up with two friends who eat all the \n",
      "hors d'oeuvres.\n",
      "Eww!\n",
      "Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't \n",
      "half bad.\n",

      "(thoughtful) Really?\n",
      "Hey, why are those kids following you? \n",
      "Do you have candy stuck to your ass?\n",
      "You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need \n",
      "surgery. You look great the way you \n",
      "are.\n",
      "But you're better than normal, you're \n",
      "abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't \n",

      "Bah! I think she looked fine before.\n",
      "This is so unfair! I liked you back \n",

      "point remains valid!\n",
      "What's so wonderful about Leela being \n",
      "normal? The rest of us aren't normal \n",

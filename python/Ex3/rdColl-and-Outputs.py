# Our challenge: read in multiple text files from a directory:
# Our resource: The Python os module + a handy code example:
#  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-read-multiple-text-files-from-folder-in-python/
import spacy
import os, shutil
# What is os? This is a library that allows Python to read your operating system (os).
# This will let Python read and interpret file paths on your local computer.
# shutil will let us remove unwanted files from a directory.

# FOR XML OUTPUT: You'll need to install dicttoxml
# pip install dicttoxml, or use the Pycharm package manager
from dicttoxml import dicttoxml
# xml.dom.minidom comes with Python so you have it already
from xml.dom.minidom import parseString

# FOR DATAFRAMES OUTPUT
# You'll need to install pandas
# pip install pandas, or use the Pycharm package manager
import pandas as pd

# FOR JSON OUTPUT
import json


#nlp = spacy.cli.download("en_core_web_md")
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')
# AFTER THE FIRST DOWNLOAD, COMMENT OUT the spacy.cli.download(...) variable.
# Your spaCy language model will already be stored in your Python environment.
# ABOUT WHAT SPACY SHOULD LOAD: Some tutorials direct us to en_core_web_md
# There are _sm, _md, and _lg models built into spaCy. Each takes up more space than the others, but
# contains more data so may be more accurate/precise.
# If we try the sm model, we're told that it does not have word vectors loaded, so it uses tagger, parser and NER (named
# entity recognition to calculate similarity instead. Better to switch to the md model--but worth comparing results!

    # ***************  HOW TO OUTPUT DICTIONARY STRUCTURES  ****************
    # If we convert it to a string, it comes out as a list of tuples.
    # That's okay, but it's not a great data structure to work with.
    # Let's try outputting a few different data structures from a dictionary

    # ============================================ #
    # PICKLING: DICTIONARY OUTPUT METHOD 1
    # ============================================ #
    # This would make a .pkl binary file object, not readable as a string of text,
    # but preserving the data structure as a dictionary. You import the pickle module to do this.
    # Python serializes and deserializes "pickle" files as data objects. Works inside total Python environments.
    # For more on pickling your data, see https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pickle-python-tutorial
    # The rest of the data formats are for serializing in forms of text media:

 # ============================================ #
    # DICTIONARY OUTPUTS TO TEXT MEDIA FORMATS
    # ============================================ #
    # We will output each of the TEXT MEDIA outputs INSIDE THE FOR LOOP to create well-formed outputs:

# EMPTY and CREATE THREE OUTPUT FOLDERS:
# First check and see, do these folders exist? If so, remove them
# because Python won't allow you to overwrite them
if os.path.exists("JSON-output"):
    shutil.rmtree("JSON-output")
if os.path.exists("csv-output"):
    shutil.rmtree("csv-output")
if os.path.exists("xml-output"):
    shutil.rmtree("xml-output")

os.mkdir('JSON-output')
os.mkdir('csv-output')
os.mkdir('xml-output')

for file in sorted(os.listdir(CollPath)):
    # My filenames are numbered, so I controlled the order of the for loop by sorting them.
    if file.endswith(".txt"):
        filepath = f"{CollPath}/{file}"
        print(filepath)
        filenameTxt = os.path.basename(filepath).split('/')[-1]
        filename = filenameTxt[:-4]
        print(filename)
        similarityData = readTextFiles(filepath)

        # ============================================ #
        # JSON: DICTIONARY OUTPUT METHOD 2
        # ============================================ #
        # JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
        # It's an adaptable file serialization format for dictionary structures used for web programming
        stringKeys = {str(key): val for key, val in similarityData.items()}
        print(f'{stringKeys=}')
        with open(f'JSON-output/{filename}.json', 'w') as fp:
            JSON = json.dumps(stringKeys)
            print(f'{JSON=}')
            json.dump(stringKeys, fp)

        # ============================================ #
        # PANDAS DATA FRAMES: DICTIONARY OUTPUT METHOD 3
        # ============================================ #
        # Data Frames are used heavily in data analytics.
        # They make a tabular (table) structure and are easily output as a CSV or TSV text file
        df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(similarityData.items(), orient="columns")
        df.columns = ['token', 'similarity']
        print(df)
        df.to_csv(f'csv-output/{filename}.tsv', sep='\t', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
        # I want to make a tsv file (tab-separated values), so I'm using the \t here.
        # to make a comma-separated values csv, put in a ','

    # ============================================ #
    # XML: DICTIONARY OUTPUT METHOD 4
    # ============================================ #
    # This tutorial is good: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialize-python-dictionary-to-xml/
        xml = dicttoxml(similarityData)
        dom = parseString(xml)
        # dom is just a string. We can pretty print it in the console,
        # but this is not good for writing to an XML file.
        print(dom.toprettyxml())
        with open(f'xml-output/{filename}.xml', 'w') as xmlFile:
            xml_decode = xml.decode()
            xmlFile.write(xml_decode)
            xmlFile.close()

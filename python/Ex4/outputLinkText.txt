all
the wings
crying
hate
you
I’m
you
your 
are
you
To find the door, you must be clever, 
Else you will be lost forever. 	No amount of magic spells, 
Will aid you if you seek the wells. 
Don’t forget the trodden trail, 
For those who do are doomed to fail.
Remember what’s been found and learned. 
The pen is not a gift, but earned.
The safest place to hide creation:
Hands that lack imagination. 
Remember what’s been found and learned. 
The safest place to hide creation: 
Hands that lack imagination. 
The fairies that the dragon stole, 
Were all set free from his control. 
The fairy’s magic left forever, 
Tackled by a boy more clever. 
The dragon lost his breath and flight, 
Never more to start a fight. 
The stolen fairies, safe and sound, 
Those they lost would now be found. 
The dragon and his fairy friend, 
Were sent away at story’s end, 
To live inside a darkened cloud, 
Where only warlugs are allowed.
